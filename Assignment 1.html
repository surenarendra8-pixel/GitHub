        <p>This page was inspired by a tweet fron salma. Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and accessible. But here we are. I'm trying my best.</p>

    <main style="border: 2px solid skyblue; background: orange;"><h3>How does this work?</h3>
        <p>The key to a lot of this leveraging using with a role="presentation" attribute to make decorated sections without css. if you view source on the page, 
           you"ll see that there are a lot of tables. The table tag typicaly is used to display tabular data and should NOT be used as a layout method. However, 
           since I am not allowed to use css. I am pretty much exclusively relying on tables for this purpose. The presentation role tells the browser to not 
           expose the table and its tabular children in the accessibility tree. This will make it easier to navigate for assistive technology.</p>
